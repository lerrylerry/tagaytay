                <p>Cafe Voi La gives off a very oriental ambiance that makes the restaurant a must-visit when youâ€™re in Tagaytay. Now one of their best-selling dishes is their Chicken Satay. Served with a bowl of turmeric rice, and a side dish of peanut sauce and Achar, the chicken is smoky, tender, and tasty with every bite. It will leave you gasping for more.</p>
